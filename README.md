The Inventory Mobile App is a cross-platform mobile application built with Expo that enables users to manage stock, track inventory levels, and update product data offline using a local SQLite database. The project demonstrates how to build robust mobile applications with local-first architecture, modular components, and a focus on performance and usability. 

## Tech Stack

React Native (Expo) · TypeScript · SQLite · Drizzle ORM · React Hook Form · Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind)

## Key Features

- ✅ Offline-first architecture using SQLite for local data storage
- ⚙️ Drizzle ORM integration for querying and schema management
- 📦 Inventory management features: add, update, delete stock items
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI built with NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native)
- 📋 Form validation with React Hook Form + Zod
- 🔄 Sync-ready structure (prepares local data for future cloud sync integration)

## My Role & Contributions

### UI/UX Design 

Designed the mobile app’s layout and navigation based on mockups created in Figma, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Local Data Layer

Integrated SQLite with Drizzle ORM for efficient local storage and schema-safe queries.

### Cross-platform Development

Built and tested on both Android and iOS using Expo, ensuring consistent behavior across devices.

### Research & Architecture

Explored and documented architectural patterns for local-first apps, and evaluated alternative state and data management strategies.

### Web Compatibility

Aligned the mobile app structure with a corresponding web admin panel, enabling seamless data interaction and a consistent user model across platforms.

## Use Cases

This app is ideal for:

- Small businesses needing an offline inventory tracking tool
- Field agents or warehouse managers without reliable internet access
- Developers seeking a template for offline-first mobile apps
